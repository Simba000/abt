  <h1>About Me Page</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Emba, and I am a 17-year-old running start student who attends Redmond High School part-time. I also participate in an indoor soccer league in Redmond. Soccer is my all-time favorite sport. My objectives for this year are to complete my high school requirements and, hopefully, to begin work on my major computer science.</p>
